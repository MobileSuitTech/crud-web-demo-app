# crud-web-demo-app
demo app that showcases aptitude in making an interactive web app with database, containerized

so far only the front-end is done and we connected to version control Git


Node.js version required: 6.9.x , current: 6.14.4
npm: required: 3.x.x , current: 6.4.1

new:
node js			current 10.9.0  needed 8.9
@angular/cli 	current	6.1.5	needed 6.1.5
npm				current 6.4.1	needed 5.1.1


to get the latest of node and npm:

install npm, then:
sudo npm install npm@latest -g
sudo npm cache clean -f
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n latest

after creating an angular project with angular-cli, 
don't forget to do the audit to remove the vulnerabilities (it reminds you of it)
