what to do next for integration:
how to integrate, what steps do we take next?
>first look at both index.html files and see what we can put together
DONE
>then find out a way to make one item not being stored, but being fetched 
from Mongodb
>HOWOWOWOW????
>first add 2 fields and make them just strings (we'll do date later)
DONE
>when doing Add Item now it must send it to the database
>have open both controllers in my text editor and see how we can incorporate from the nice looking one to the ToDo one...
...damn here we have a problem because both controllers are not the same 
.. we may have to use the way that the ToDo app does in its controller ...but that means that we would have to change the angular version of the 
...nice looking site maybe breaking it?...
>let's try it by changing the angular script that we import in the .html
>okay just found a bug where in the new app we can enter a new item 
that has a blank value legally instead of it being illegal...
>so maybe the solution is to use the code from nice app and incorporate 
mongo access from older app into it, let's see if that works
>does that mean we also need to start adding mongo now?
maybe it's time to bring in the html from nice into ToDo? as well as the 
controller?
only way to find out is to do that very thing but see if it will still work because we are using a new angular in the nice one and an old one 
in ToDo so the mongo access may not work, how to find out?
just try it maybe
but try whaht?
maybe we can start by moving the new html into the old correct directory...
>now put the controller!!!
OKAY EVERYTHING WORKS PRETTY NICELY NOW, LET'S JUST MAKE MONGO WORK!!!!

>the goal here being to MAKE THE MONGO DATA RETRIEVAL WORK....
